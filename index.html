    <h1>welcome to you all</h1>
    <p>
      GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version
      control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web
      pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for
      real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build
      and edit their site content.
